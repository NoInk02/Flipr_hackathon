# AI-Powered Customer Support Platform Framework

## Overview

This framework provides a smarter, AI-driven solution to transform customer support operations by leveraging:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with Google Gemini via API keys  
- **Company-specific knowledge bases** extracted from company documents (PDF → JSON)  
- **Semantic search** using ChromaDB embeddings for fast, relevant answers  
- **Emotion detection** to personalize chatbot responses and enable deeper analytics  
- **Automated ticket creation and intelligent agent assignment** to balance workloads  
- **Agent chatbot assistant** with access to company data and ongoing tickets  
- **Feedback collection and CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) analysis** powered by AI  
- **Admin dashboard** for real-time analytics, performance tracking, and insights

## System Workflow

1. **Company Registration & Document Upload**  
   Companies register on the platform and upload relevant documents (e.g., manuals, FAQs, policy PDFs). These are converted into structured JSON to build a custom knowledge base.

2. **Knowledge Base Updates**  
   Companies can regularly update their documents and synchronize the knowledge base to keep information fresh.

3. **Client-Side Chatbot with RAG**  
   Customers interact with a chatbot powered by Google Gemini. The chatbot uses semantic search (ChromaDB) on company-specific data to provide accurate, contextual answers.

4. **Emotion Detection**  
   The chatbot detects user emotions during conversations, adjusting its tone for politeness and collecting emotion data for analytics.

5. **Issue Escalation & Ticketing**  
   If the chatbot cannot resolve an issue, users can raise support tickets. Tickets are assigned to the least busy available agent via an intelligent load balancing algorithm.

6. **Agent Interface**  
   Agents can view tickets, access AI-generated suggestions on relevant documents, and chat with an internal assistant bot that has access to company data and historical tickets.

7. **Feedback & CSAT Analytics**  
   After each chat session, users can optionally provide feedback and ratings. The system uses AI to generate summarized feedback and analyzes scores over time to suggest chatbot improvements.

8. **Admin Dashboard**  
   Provides visualization of chatbot performance metrics, CSAT trends, emotion distributions, and agent workload.
